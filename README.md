## Key Features
- Implementation of popular clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical).
- Visual representation of clustering results.
- Insights into data segmentation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`

## Usage
Run the notebook cell by cell in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to reproduce the analysis.
